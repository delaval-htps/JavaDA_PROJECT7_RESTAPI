# spring-boot-skeleton

## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the com.nnk.springboot.Application.java from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin like so:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

## Technical:
This application was upgraded 'cause of some jars for examle for hibernate's validation not compatibles. Now this application uses:
1. Framework: Spring Boot v2.7.6
2. Framework: SpringSecurity 5
3. Java 8
4. Thymeleaf
5. Bootstrap v.4.3.1
6. Junit v.5.9.1
7. Jacoco v.0.8.7

## Run test
We used TDD to implement code in this project:

So, from creation of integration and unit tests, we created the source's code and check it to be sure of its correct working.

* To run unit tests only, you can use command: 
    ```shell
    mvn test
    ```

* To run integration tests only, you can use command:
    ```shell
   mvn failsafe:integration-test
    ```
* If you want to launch a build phase without integration tests, you can use next option for example:  
  ```shell
    mvn verify -Dskip.it=true
    ```
## Jacoco Coverage

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="src/main/resources/static/images/coverage.png"
     alt="coverage" width="100%" />
</p>

A report of coverage is automatically done when you launch tests.

You can access to it at location :

* For a report of unit tests : `target/site/jacoco/index.html`  after launch `mvn test`

* For a report of integration tests : `target/site/jacoco-it/index.html`  after launch `mvn verify jacoco:report-integration`
