# spring-boot-skeleton

## Setup before first launch of application

Before running application for the first time, we have to create database to have at least a user 'admin' for logging:

 1. Create a database with name "demo" as configuration in `application-dev-properties`
 2. Run the sql script, to create table and insert data, located in `setup/data.sql` 
   
After that, we can run the application as usual.


## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the com.nnk.springboot.Application.java from your favorite IDE.

Alternatively you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin like so:
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Login 


* ### <u>Login with credential</u>


Since application is running, from the HOME PAGE , you can log in with credential by clicking on one of the fllowing link:

* ***"Login"*** (access as a simple user) 
* ***"User management"*** (acces as administrator role to manage users of application: add new one,update or delete one...)

For the first time running application, on the Login page, you need to login  with these credentials (previously imported by the sql script):

* username: `admin`
* passwd: `Admin4&verPoseidon`

Thus, your are admin and can add other user !

* ### <u>Login with Github</u>
  
From the login page, if you have a github account and, if and only if, an administrator has created a user account for you in the application, you will also be able to login with OAuth2 by clicking on the link:


***"Login with Github"***

## Technical:


This application was upgraded 'cause of some jars for examle for hibernate's validation not compatibles. Now this application uses:
1. Framework: Spring Boot v2.7.6
2. Framework: SpringSecurity 5.7.5
3. Hibernate 5.6.14
4. Java 8
5. Thymeleaf 3.0.15
6. Bootstrap v.4.3.1
7. Log4j2 v2.17.1
8. Junit4 v.4.13.2
9. Jacoco v.0.8.7
10. Mysql 8.0.31 & H2 2.1.214 db

## Run test

We used TDD to implement code in this project:

So, from creation of integration and unit tests, we created the source's code and check it to be sure of its correct working.

As we need a database for integration tests with test-cases,we use a H2 database without any configuration.


* To run unit tests only, you can use command: 
    ```shell
    mvn test
    ```

* To run integration tests only, you can use command:
    ```shell
   mvn failsafe:integration-test
    ```
* If you want to launch a build phase without integration tests, you can use next option for example:  
  ```shell
    mvn verify -Dskip.it=true
    ```

## Jacoco Coverage


A report of coverage is automatically done when you launch tests.
<p align="center" width="90%">
<img src="src/main/resources/static/images/coverage.png"
     alt="coverage"  />
</p>

You can access to it at location :

* For a report of unit tests : `target/site/jacoco/index.html`  after launch in directory Poseiden-skeleton:
    ```shell
    mvn test
    ```

* For a report of integration tests : `target/site/jacoco-it/index.html`  after launch in directory Poseiden-skeleton:
  ```shell
    mvn verify jacoco:report-integration
    ```
